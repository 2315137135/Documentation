## Text

The created mesh will be 3D object created as an extrusion of a given text. It will have its origin at the center of the text.

## Prerequesite

The ```MeshBuilder.CreateText``` is leveraging our ExtrudePolygon feature which requires you to have **Earcut library available**. Whilst an Earcut script is pre-loaded in the Playground you will have to add a reference to such a script in your own projects. One is available at [cdn](https://unpkg.com/earcut@2.1.1/dist/earcut.min.js) or via a [npm package](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut#install).


## MeshBuilder

Usage :

```javascript
const fontData = await (await fetch("./fonts/Droid Sans_Regular.json")).json(); // Providing you have a font data file at that location
const text = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateText("myText", "Hello World !! @ #$ % Ã©", fontData, {
    size: 16,
    resolution: 64, 
    depth: 10
}, scene);
```

### Generating font data

To be able to trace and extrude the mesh, you have to provide font data information.
Babylon.js is supporting the fantastic work done by Gero3 on http://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/

Simply go to this site and generate the json description file for the font you want to use.

We are also offering already exported fonts on assets.babylonjs.com:
* https://assets.babylonjs.com/fonts/Droid Sans_Bold.json (http://www.droidfonts.com/)
* https://assets.babylonjs.com/fonts/Droid Sans_Regular.json (http://www.droidfonts.com/)
* https://assets.babylonjs.com/fonts/Kenney Future Regular.json (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts)
